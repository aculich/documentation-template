# Welcome to our Resource Guide

Here is a lovely description of your computing center.

## Summary of Resources

Include a concise summary of what is available to users.

## Features of this Guide

* The **navigation panel** on the left provides you with a birds-eye view of the content of these pages.
* GitBook **search** at the top of the right-hand side allows you to list only content that matches your keywords.

## Information about this Template

**GitBook Things**
- The contents of the `SUMMARY.md` file represent the left-hand navigation menu when viewing the GitBook. While GitBook has the ability to generate this automatically, it is nice to have more control over it.
- `README.md` serves as your GitBook's landing page.

**Images**
The standard markdown code for inserting pictures does not allow any specifications of size, border, etc. You may consider inserting your images using html which will be rendered properly by GitHub and GitBook, as shown below.

```
<img src="screenshots/cyberduck-os-vm.png" style="border-style:ridge;border-color:#bfbfbf;border-width:1px;width:550px;" /></a>
```
