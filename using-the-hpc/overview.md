# Overview of HPC Condos

The CADES Scalable HPC (HPC) Condos consist of two HPC clusters: one in the ORNL Moderate protection zone (CADES Mod) and one in the ORNL Open protection zone (CADES Open).

To get started using the HPC Condo, check first to see if you are ready by looking over the [prerequisites](how-to-use/prerequisites.md). Then, learn how to [request access](how-to-use/request-access.md). Finally, you are ready to [access your Condo allocation](how-to-use/access-HPC.md).

_The list of current groups according to divisions at ORNL can be found [here](how-to-use/request-access.md)._
