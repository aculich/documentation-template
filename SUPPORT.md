# Support

There are a few options when encountering a computing issue. See below for the option which best describes your situation.

- I need help with my scripts.

  Visit the CCLA to get help from peers.

- I cannot access CCLA resources (i.e. password/username problem).

  Email the [CCLA](mailto:ccla@doane.edu) or visit the [Doane HelpDesk](https://helpdesk.doane.edu/portal) website.
