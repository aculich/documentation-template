## Acknowledgments in Publications and Presentations

Please acknowledge in your publications the role that the computing facilities played in your research. Alerting our communications staff when a paper is accepted is also appreciated.

Sample acknowledgement:

> This research used resources of the University of Oz, which is supported by Glenda the Good Witch under Contract No. DE-XXXX-XXXXXX"


You may use any variation on this theme, calling out specific simulations or portions of the research that used our resources, or citing specific resources used.

However, the crucial elements to include are:

* The spelled out center name (it's okay to include the acronym, too)
* Funding Institution
* Contract No.

We appreciate your conscientiousness in this matter. Acknowledgement and pre-publication notification helps the Computing Center communicate the importance of its role in science to our sponsors, helping assure the continued availability of this valuable resource.
