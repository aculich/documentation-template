## Acknowledgments in Publications and Presentations

Please acknowledge in your publications the role that the CCLA facilities played in your research. Alerting our communications staff when a paper is accepted is also appreciated.

Sample acknowledgement:

> This research used resources of the Compute and Data Environment for Science (CADES) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-XXXX-XXXXXX"


You may use any variation on this theme, calling out specific simulations or portions of the research that used CCLA resources, or citing specific resources used.

However, the crucial elements to include are:

* The spelled out center name (it's okay to include the acronym, too): Center for Computing in the Liberal Arts (CCLA)
* Office of Science and U.S. Department of Energy
* Contract No. DE-XXXX-XXXXXXXX

We appreciate your conscientiousness in this matter. Acknowledgement and pre-publication notification helps the CCLA communicate the importance of its role in science to our sponsors, helping assure the continued availability of this valuable resource.
